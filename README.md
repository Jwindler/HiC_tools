### CNV-aware normalization

- Hi-C data normalization considering CNVs. Extension of matrix-balancing algorithm to either retain the copy-number variation effect (LOIC) or remove them (CAIC). ICE itself can lead to misrepresentation of the contact probabilities between CNV regions. Estimating CNV directly from Hi-C data correcting for GC content, mappability, fragment length using Poisson regression. LOIC - the sum of contacts for a given genomic bin is proportional to CNV. CAIC - raw interaction counts are the product of a CNV bias matrix and the expected contact counts at a given genomic distance.

- [iRegNet3D](http://iregnet3d.yulab.org/index/) - Integrated Regulatory Network 3D (iRegNet3D) is a high-resolution regulatory network comprised of interfaces of all known transcription factor (TF)-TF, TF-DNA interaction interfaces, as well as chromatin-chromatin interactions and topologically associating domain (TAD) information from different cell lines. Goal: SNP interpretation. Input: One or several SNPs, rsIDs, or genomic coordinates. Output: For one or two SNPs, on-screen information of their disease-related info, connection over TF-TF and chromatin interaction networks, and whether they interact in 3D and located within TADs. For multiple SNPs, the same info downloadable as text files. http://iregnet3d.yulab.org/index/
